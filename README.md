<h1>Recovering a System After a Failed BIOS Update</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved diagnosing and resolving a critical issue caused by a failed BIOS update, which left the clientâ€™s PC unable to boot. The goal was to restore the system to a functional state without data loss or hardware replacement. By utilizing advanced troubleshooting techniques, I identified the corrupted firmware as the root cause and implemented recovery methods, including BIOS re-flashing via a USB boot drive. This process successfully revived the system and ensured stable operation, showcasing my ability to handle complex system-level failures with precision and efficiency.
